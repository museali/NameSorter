# Name sorter

## The Goal:
> Build a name sorter. Given a set of names, order that set first by last name, then by any given names the
  person may have. A name must have at least 1 given name and may have up to 3 given names.

## Runing the program
> Make sure the build is passing.
> In your terminal, navigate to the following directory NameSorter\bin\Debug.
> Here you find the text file where we will get the sorted names from 'unsorted-names-list.txt'.
> Run the application in your terminal with the following command " NameSorter ./unsorted-names-list.txt" or ".\NameSorter unsorted-names-list.txt".
> In the same directory a file named 'sorted-names-list.txt' is created.
